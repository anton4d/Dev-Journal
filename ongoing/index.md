# ongoing projects

This section lists all currently active projects
 with more detail than the [main index](../index.md).

To be considered "ongoing," a project should show activity at least once a month.
If a project becomes inactive, it will be either:

- moved to the **archive** (if dropped permanently), or
- moved to **on-hold** (if I plan to return to it later)
