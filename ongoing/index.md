# ongoing projects
This section lists all currently active projects with more detail than the [main index](../index.md).

To be considered "ongoing," a project should show activity at least once a month.
If a project becomes inactive, it will be either:
- moved to the **archive** (if dropped permanently), or 
- moved to **on-hold** (if I plan to return to it later)

| Project | Started | Description | Language | Goal |
